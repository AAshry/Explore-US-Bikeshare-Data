### Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

# Overview
In this project, I used  Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I wrote code to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
I Have also written a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
